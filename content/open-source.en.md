Much of the code I develop for applications and research are open source.
Over the years I've managed to build a long track record of public contributions that you can find on my GitHub profile {{< github/tag >}}.

If you're interested, please check out an [overview](#overview) of my repos.
Or why not take a look into my [résumé]({{< relref "/cv" >}})!

## How to help?

I like to bring _well-documented libraries_ to the open source community.
Most of the time, I write code for _Python_, _Kotlin_, _Android_ or _Java_.
I also often explore other fields and frameworks, such as _Flutter_ or _LaTeX_.
But maintaining open source projects while working full time can be difficult.
Sponsoring helps me to assign more time for open source contributions and to cover university expenses.

You can sponsor me via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/heinrichreimer) or via [PayPal](https://paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=6XPPSCX7MQD3W). Thank you very much!
