Much of the code I develop for applications and research is open source.
Over the years I have thus contributed to a number of open-source projects.
Check out my GitHub profile {{< github/tag >}} to learn more.

I have also compiled an [overview](#overview) of my repos down below.

### Sponsoring

I like to bring self-documented libraries to the open-source community.
Most of the time, I write code for Python, Kotlin, Android or Java, but I also explore other langugages and frameworks, such as Flutter or LaTeX.
Maintaining open-source projects while working full-time is challenging.
Sponsoring helps me to assign more time for open source contributions and to cover hosting expenses.

You can sponsor me via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/heinrichreimer) or [PayPal](https://paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=6XPPSCX7MQD3W). Thank you very much!

A big thanks to the people who already sponsor (or have sponsored) my open source work:
