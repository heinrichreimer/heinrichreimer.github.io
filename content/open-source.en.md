Much of the code I write and the applications I develop are open source.

### Why?

I focus on bringing _well-documented libraries_ to the open source community.
Most of the time, I write for _Kotlin_, _Android_ or _Java_, but I like to explore new fields and frameworks, such as _Flutter_ or _LaTeX_.

Sponsoring helps me find more time for contributions.
Besides, it also helps cover university-related expenses.
