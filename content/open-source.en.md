Much of the code I write and the applications I develop are open source.
You can find them on my GitHub profile {{< github/tag >}}.

{{< github/stats >}}

If you're interested, please also check out more [detailed statistics](#statistics) below.
And I'd be glad if you'd take a look into my [resume]({{< relref "/cv" >}})!

## Become a sponsor

### Why?

I focus on bringing _well-documented libraries_ to the open source community.
Most of the time, I write for _Kotlin_, _Android_ or _Java_, but I like to explore new fields and frameworks, such as _Flutter_ or _LaTeX_.

Sponsoring helps me find more time for contributions.
Besides, it also helps cover university-related expenses.

### How?

1. Via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/heinrichreimer)
2. Via [PayPal](https://paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=6XPPSCX7MQD3W)

### Who?

This is a _Hall of Fame_ of my sponsors:
