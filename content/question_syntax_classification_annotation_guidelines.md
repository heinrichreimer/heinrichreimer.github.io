The task is to identify whether a text is a question and whether it is a yes/no question.

#### Question or not?

A piece of text can contain several sentences.

Label a text as a question if:
1. it is one single interrogative sentence, that is, a question  
   <small>_Examples:_
   - Does aspirin help with headaches?
   - How much aspirin should I take?
   </small>
2. it contains several sentences, one of which is a question (see above)  
   <small>_Examples:_
   - I have a headache. Does aspirin help?
   - Where can I buy aspirin? My head hurts!
   </small>
3. typos, smaller grammatical errors, or incorrect word ordering should be ignored (label as a question)  
   <small>_Examples:_
   - Do aspirin help with headache? (typos)
   - Does aspirin help headache? (missing word)
   - Does aspirin help with headaches (missing question mark)
   </small>

Label a text as **not** a question if all sentences within the text are:
1. declarative sentences (assertions or statements)  
   <small>_Examples:_
   - Aspirin is good for headaches. 
   - I use aspirin when I have a headache.
   </small>
2. imperative sentences, i.e., commands  
   <small>_Examples:_
   - Use aspirin if you have headaches.
   - Tell me if aspirin is good for headaches.
   </small>
3. exclamatory sentences, i.e., exclamations  
   <small>_Examples:_
   - How good aspirin is!
   - What a bad drug aspirin is!
   </small>
4. ill-formed questions, i.e., questions that do not start with a question word or auxiliary verb  
   <small>_Examples:_
   - Aspirin helps for headache?
   - Take aspirin at night?
   </small>

#### Yes/no question or not?

Label a text as a yes/no question if:
1. the text is a question (see above) _and_
2. the question can be answered by either "yes" or "no"  
   <small>_Examples:_
   - Should I use aspirin?
   - Does aspirin help with headaches?
   </small>

Label a text as **not** a yes/no question if:
- the text is _not_ a question (see above) _or_
- the question is open-ended, i.e., it starts with a question word (where? who? and so on)  
  <small>_Examples:_
  - Who can use aspirin?
  - How effective is aspirin for headaches?
  </small>
- the question has multiple explicit choices, e.g., comparisons  
  <small>_Examples:_
  - I have a headache. Should I use aspirin or paracetamol?
  - Does aspirin work better for children or adults?
  </small>

#### Summary
Please read each text and label whether the text is a yes/no question&nbsp;(shortcut `1`), a question&nbsp;(shortcut `2`), or not interrogative at all&nbsp;(shortcut `3`).
