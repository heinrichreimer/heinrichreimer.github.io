The task is to identify whether a scientific abstract answers the given health-related question.
For each question, assess abstracts on:
1. How useful is this abstract for answering the question?
2. For abstracts that are useful, what answer do they support? "Yes" or "no"?

#### Usefulness Grades
- Not-useful (`0`)  
  The abstract either does not address the question, or fails to address all parts of a question.  
  <small>_Example:_
  If the question is "Does yoga improve the
  management of asthma?" and the document only talks about yoga without talking about asthma or talks about asthma but not yoga, then the document is not-useful.
  </small>  
  Abstracts are always **not** useful if they:
  - are not English
  - contain adult material, or
  - are garbled, empty, unreadable or otherwise broken.
- Useful (_then judge answer below_)  
  The abstract either directly answers the question or provides enough information to determine an answer. Abstracts that only ask about the effectiveness of a specific treatment but only merely mention the health issue or treatment of the question are **not** useful. A useful abstract must address _all_ parts of the question and help to make a yes/no decision.

**Important:** For a useful abstract, it does not matter whether you believe the information provided in that abstract is correct or incorrect. Only judge whether a user would likely find the information  useful regardless of the document's correctness.  
<small>_Example:_
Two very-useful documents could have different answers (i.e., yes and no) to the same question, but both would be viewed to be high quality results from credible sources suitable as top 10 web search results.

#### Answer
For useful abstracts, judge whether the answer to the question is "yes" or "no" according to the abstract.
- Yes (`1`)
  The abstract says the answer to the question is "yes" or provides strong support that would lead to the conclusion that the answer is "yes".
- No (`2`)
  The abstract says the answer to the question is "no" or provides strong support that would lead to the conclusion that the answer is "no".
- Unclear (`3`)
  The abstract addresses the question, but a user would not be able to conclude either "yes" or "no" given the abstract.

#### Summary
Please read each topic's question and description. Then rate each abstract's usefulness and answer to the question (only if abstract is useful).
