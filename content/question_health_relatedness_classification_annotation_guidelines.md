The task is to identify whether a natural question is health related and/or medical.

#### Health related or not?
Health-related question can be any question about human or animal health, both physical and mental. 
Some of the topics such questions can address are:
- physical, mental, social well-being  
  <small>_Examples:_ I'm not feeling well, what should I do? How to cope with being bullied in class?
  </small>
- diseases, illnesses, disorders, medical conditions  
  <small>_Examples:_ I got the flu, should I call a doctor? How do I know I have measles?
  </small>
- physical or mental states (like pregnancy, aging, etc.)  
  <small>_Examples:_ Can I smoke during pregnancy? What is a normal age to get hair loss?
  </small>
- diagnosis, prevention, risk factors  
  <small>_Examples:_ How to test for covid? Are men more likely to get a heart attack?
  </small>
- treatments, medication, drugs, exercises  
  <small>_Examples:_ Can aspirin reduce fever? I had a stroke, which exercises can I do?
  </small>
- healthcare service, social measures  
  <small>_Examples:_ Where's the next physician? Does the american healthcare system work?
  </small>
- anatomy, biochemical processes  
  <small>_Examples:_ How much oxygen does a fish need to survive? How tall is the average woman?
  </small>
- fitness, sports, lifestyle, sex, and nutrition  
  <small>_Examples:_ How often should I go to the gym? Should I use a condom? Is green tea healthy?
  </small>

Label a question as **not** health related if:
- it is only asking for references or navigation  
  <small>_Examples:_ What papers are worth reading about cancer? Where can I find websites about pilates?
  </small>
- it is a purely factual biological question (i.e., there is no direct influence on health)  
  <small>_Examples:_ Can fish breathe? Are bacteria animals?
  </small>

#### Medical or not?
Medical questions are health-related questions that require additional, professional expertise, that often motivate clinical studies and research.

Label a question as medical if:
- the question is health related (see above) _and_
- one would usually seek professional advice (e.g., from a doctor, nurse, pharmacist, or therapist)  
  <small>_Examples:_
  - Why do I have diarrhea for 3 days?
  - I haven't had my period. Am I pregnant?
  </small>
- it cannot be answered by laymen  
  <small>_Examples:_
  - Which variant of Covid is the most dangerous?
  - What are the best therapy options for depression?
  </small>
- wrong answers could cause severe harm  
  <small>_Examples:_
  - What is the best dosage of ibuprofen for a child?
  - How to cure a snakebite?
  </small>

Label a question as **not** medical if:
- the question is _not_ health related (see above) _or_
- the answer is mostly common sense, even for laymen  
  <small>_Examples:_
  - Are soft or hard mattresses healthier?
  - Do bacteria cause harm to my health?
  - Can I drink too much beer?
  </small>
- the answer mostly depends on personal preference  
  <small>_Examples:_
  - How many steps should I do each day?
  - What's your preferred way of losing weight?
  </small>
